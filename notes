TRANSDUCER - array of TRANSDUCERS
- Instrument Pressure \d # As Found
- Master Value \d   # Gauge Reading Set Point
- Note: IP1 = MV1

Once selected, prompt for "As Found", "As Left", or "Both"
- If as left, proppt for as found file. etc etc.
- If both, continue on with logic.

If Transducer Name contains "CUSTOM" - prompt for the name in an input box  (change to Type)
Part Number: "CTS A12-221" Value "250CCM"

Data to always enter in
- Instrument
- Customer Name
- Customer Address
- Control Number
- Serial Number
- Accuracy (once, but applies to the full List)
- Barometric Pressure
- Temperature
- Humidity


Auto Data
- Date [Verify Date]
- Part Number  "middle number from Part Name/Type variable"


Calculations: etc
- High Limit/ Low Limit eg: (SPAN*1.0005 + column) (SPAN*0.9995 - column)
- Delta =  abs(gauge reading) - abs(asleft|asfound)
- PSIA - PRESSURE
- SCCM - FLOW
- TRANSDUCER1 Will ALWAYS be pressure

CONFIG:
- Mensor Numbers etc
	- Cal device, cal serial, Cal cal date, cal due date


# HARDWARE CALIBRATION
 -  "Mass Flow Trans"  look at `Instrument Flow` and `Master Reading`
 -  "Pressure Transducer"  `Instrument Pressure` and `Master Value`
-  Always take the SECOND `Master Value`
