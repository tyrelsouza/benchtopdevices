            Creates a virtual element that is visible on the elements trace when the layout overflow exception is thrown.
            This can be used to easily identify elements inside the elements trace tree and faster find issue root cause.

            The DPI (pixels-per-inch) at which images and features without native PDF support will be rasterized.
            A larger DPI would create a PDF that reflects the original intent with better fidelity, but it can make for larger PDF files too, which would use more memory while rendering, and it would be slower to be processed or sent online or to printer.
            When generating images, this parameter also controls the resolution of the generated content.
            Default value is 144.

            <summary>
            Encoding quality controls the trade-off between size and quality.
            When the image is opaque, it will be encoded using the JPEG format with the selected quality setting.
            When the image contains an alpha channel, it is always encoded using the PNG format and this option is ignored.

            This is the combination of both of the FitWidth and the FitHeight options. 
            The element scales to occupy the entire available area while preserving its aspect ratio.
            This means that sometimes it occupies the entire width and sometimes the entire height.
            This is the safest option.

            Each document is considered as separate in terms of page numbering.
            That means, all page number related APIs will return values based on original documents.
            All documents will simply be merged together.
            For example: let's suppose that two documents are merged, first with 2 pages and second with 3 pages.
            The resulting document will have 5 pages, and page numbers will be: 1, 2, 1, 2, 3.

        <member name="P:QuestPDF.Settings.DocumentLayoutExceptionThreshold">
            <summary>
            This value represents the maximum number of pages that the library produces.
            This is useful when layout constraints are too strong, e.g. one element does not fit in another.
            In such cases, the library would produce document of infinite length, consuming all available resources.
            To break the algorithm and save the environment, the library breaks the rendering process after reaching specified length of document.
            If your content requires generating longer documents, please assign the most reasonable value.

            This flag generates additional document elements to improve layout debugging experience.
            When the DocumentLayoutException is thrown, the library is able to provide additional execution context.
            It includes layout calculation results and path to the problematic area.

            This flag enables checking the font glyph availability.
            If your text contains glyphs that are not present in the specified font,
            1) when this flag is enabled: the DocumentDrawingException is thrown. OR 
            2) when this flag is disabled: placeholder characters are visible in the produced PDF file. 
            Enabling this flag may slightly decrease document generation performance.
            However, it provides hints that used fonts are not sufficient to produce correct results.
